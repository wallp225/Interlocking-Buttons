# Interlocking-Buttons
How many Scripts should I use in this project?

Click.cs handles OnMouseDown action when a user clicks a button.
Interlock-Check.cs will be a logic check to see whether a button can be pressed or not.

Interlocking Buttons are two buttons that can be clicked by a user.  If one button is clicked the user should not be able to click on the other button.
